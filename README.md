### About Me
I am a Machine Learning Engineer and MS Computer Science student at **NYU Courant**.

My interests lie in **representation learning, large-scale model training, and evaluation-driven ML systems**, with a focus on how learned representations support **perception, decision-making, and adaptation** in real-world settings. I’m particularly interested in **learning from multimodal data (vision, language, and actions)**, scalable training and inference, and **rigorous evaluation of model behavior**.

I aim to work on problems at the intersection of **applied ML, Representation Learning, and ML systems**, and I am actively seeking **research opportunities**. If you’re working on LLMs, ML systems, or applied AI, feel free to reach out.
